        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA):</strong> Students progress from hands-on tools (e.g., cubes) to visual models (e.g., bar diagrams) to abstract equations.</li>
            <li><strong>Mastery Approach:</strong> Fewer topics are taught in greater depth, ensuring students master each concept before moving on.</li>
            <li><strong>Problem-Solving Focus:</strong> Bar modeling and mental math strategies empower students to tackle complex word problems with ease.</li>
            <li><strong>Rigorous Progression:</strong> Builds on prior knowledge, creating a strong foundation from primary grades onward.</li>
        </ul>
